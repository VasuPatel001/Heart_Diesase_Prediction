# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Approach

## About heart disease
Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No. 1 cause of death in the US.The Heart Disease and Stroke Statisticsâ€”2019 Update from the American Heart Association indicates that:

- 116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
- On average, someone dies of CVD every 38 seconds. About 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.
- On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes. About 389.4 deaths from stroke each day, based on 2016 data.

## Project Overview
In this notebook I will try to unleash useful insights using this heart disease datasets and by building stacked ensemble model by combining the power of best performing machine learning algorithms.

## About Data
Dataset is ontained from "heart statlog cleveland hungary" which is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease dataset namely from, Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA and Statlog (Heart) dataset.

This dataset consists of 11 features and a target variable. It has 6 nominal variables and 5 numeric variables. The detailed description of all the features are as follows:

1. Age: Patients Age in years (Numeric)
2. Sex: Gender of patient (Male - 1, Female - 0) (Nominal)
3. Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced by patient categorized into 1 typical, 2 typical angina, 3 non-anginal pain, 4 asymptomatic (Nominal)
4. resting bp s: Level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)
5. cholestrol: Serum cholestrol in mg/dl (Numeric)
6. fasting blood sugar: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)
7. resting ecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values 0 : Normal 1: Abnormality in ST-T wave 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (Nominal)
8. max heart rate: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)
9. exercise angina: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)
10. oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in comparison with the state of rest (Numeric)
11. ST slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise 0: Normal 1: Upsloping 2: Flat 3: Downsloping (Nominal)

### Target Variable
12. target: It is the target variable which we have to predict 1 means patient is suffering from heart risk and 0 means patient is normal.

## Installations
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries should be installed to get the project started:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
- [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)

I also reccommend to install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project which also include jupyter notebook to run and execute [IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).

## Code
Actual code to get started with the project is provided is in `heart-disease-classification.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:
`ipython notebook heart-disease-prediction.ipynb` or

`jupyter notebook heart-disease-prediction.ipynb`

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Model Evaluation
I have done model evaluation based on following sklearn metric.

1. [Cross Validation Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html)
2. [Confusion Matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)
3. [Plotting ROC-AUC Curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html)
4. [Plotting Precision recall Curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve.html)
5. [Sensitivity and Specitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity)
6. [Classification Error](https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/)
7. [Log Loss](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html)
8. [Mathew Correlation coefficient](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef.html)
