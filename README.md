# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Approach

## About heart disease
Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No. 1 cause of death in the US.The Heart Disease and Stroke Statisticsâ€”2019 Update from the American Heart Association indicates that:

- 116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
- On average, someone dies of CVD every 38 seconds. About 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.
- On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes. About 389.4 deaths from stroke each day, based on 2016 data.

## Project Overview
In this notebook I will try to unleash useful insights using this heart disease datasets and by building stacked ensemble model by combining the power of best performing machine learning algorithms.

## About Data
This dataset consists of 11 features and a target variable. It has 6 nominal variables and 5 numeric variables. The detailed description of all the features are as follows:

1. Age: Patients Age in years (Numeric)
2. Sex: Gender of patient (Male - 1, Female - 0) (Nominal)
3. Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced by patient categorized into 1 typical, 2 typical angina, 3 non-anginal pain, 4 asymptomatic (Nominal)
4. resting bp s: Level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)
5. cholestrol: Serum cholestrol in mg/dl (Numeric)
6. fasting blood sugar: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)
7. resting ecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values 0 : Normal 1: Abnormality in ST-T wave 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (Nominal)
8. max heart rate: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)
9. exercise angina: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)
10. oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in comparison with the state of rest (Numeric)
11. ST slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise 0: Normal 1: Upsloping 2: Flat 3: Downsloping (Nominal)

### Target Variable
12. target: It is the target variable which we have to predict 1 means patient is suffering from heart risk and 0 means patient is normal.

## Installations
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries should be installed to get the project started:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- xgboost

I also reccommend to install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project which also include jupyter notebook to run and execute IPython Notebook.
