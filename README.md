# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Approach

## About heart disease
Heart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No. 1 cause of death in the US.The Heart Disease and Stroke Statisticsâ€”2019 Update from the American Heart Association indicates that:

- 116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.
- On average, someone dies of CVD every 38 seconds. About 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.
- On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes. About 389.4 deaths from stroke each day, based on 2016 data.

## Project Overview
In this notebook I will try to unleash useful insights using this heart disease datasets and by building stacked ensemble model by combining the power of best performing machine learning algorithms.
